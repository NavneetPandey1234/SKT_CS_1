The Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques, taught me valuable insights into the fundamentals of cryptography. I developed a program that shifts each character in the plaintext by a fixed number, creating a basic yet effective form of encryption. It was a great way to dive deeper into how cryptographic systems work at a foundational level!
